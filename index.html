<h1> Politics. History. Data. </h1>
  <p> Political scientists have long analyzed political history as a source of insights into the past 
and contemporary politics.  Recent methodological innovations and the increased 
availability of digitized historical data have launched a revolution in the way political 
scientists can do historical analysis.  The Politics and History Network was founded in 2014 to promote the social scientific study of political history.  It sponsors an annual PhD student conference  (link to conference tab) for the presentation of data-intensive historical social science.</p>
